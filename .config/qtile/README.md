## File structure
Explanation about what do every file.<br>
They are written in singular by ease by naming them and sorted according to who is called first in the main file.<br>
Divided into 7 files in total.<br>
They're not named as they're by default, like groups -> workspaces or screens -> Bars.<br>

If something goes wrong, check debug in:<br>
`~/.local/share/qtile/qtile.log`


### Main file
**File name: "config.py"**

Is like the main function to start the wm.<br>
Import the other files config and set a few options.

### Window and frames
**File name: "window.py"**

Set the keybind to manage:<br>
**Focus, Moving, Resize, Layout and Mouse keybinds.**<br>
In general is for window manipulation.

### Workspaces
**File name: "workspace.py"**

Set all the virtual workspaces and the keybinds to switch to these.<br>
Originally called *GROUPS*, but since they take care of the virtual desks, its generic name would be.
You can adjust as many as you want.<br>
There are currently 10.

### Keybinds
**File name: "keybind.py"**

Here are the keybinds for **launch programs and scripts** but not to set the keybinds for window manage.<br>
*For manipulation of window and frames, see* [window and frames](https://github.com/yowls/dotfiles/tree/debian/.config/qtile#window-and-frames)

#### Some keybinds
| Key | Produce? |
| :-: | :------: |
| Key1| btw1     |
| Key2| btw1     |
| Key3| btw1     |
| Key4| btw1     |
| Key5| btw1     |
| Key6| btw1     |

### Theme
**File name: "Themes/'theme'.py"**

Does that, set the theme that Qtile will going to use.<br>
You can change the theme just renaming [Here](https://github.com/yowls/dotfiles/blob/debian/.config/qtile/config.py#L19)<br>
Or you can create one and put in that folder then rename again.

*For more information enter in the* [Themes folder](https://github.com/yowls/dotfiles/tree/debian/.config/qtile/Themes)

### Rules
**File name: "rule.py"**

Sets the rules that windows must comply.<br>
Â¿How to break the rules for cierta ocacion?

#### Some rules
* open browser in 2nd workspace
* 2nd workspace is floating by default
* open terminal in 1st workspace

### Startup programs
**File name: "autostart.sh"**

Sets the programs that start on login.<br>
Some of them are deamons, others are programs like the browser,compositor,etc.<br>
If you want to add a program, put **"run"** at the beginning of the line, because it is verified that it is not running. This is defined in the same function run.<br>
Otherwise, if you have, for example, the terminal open and reloads, it will spawn again as if it were starting.

### Panel
**File name: "Bars/'bar_theme'.py"**

Set the config for the panel.<br>
The call is produced [here](https://github.com/yowls/dotfiles/blob/debian/.config/qtile/config.py#L23)<br>
*For more information enter in the* [Bar Themes Folder](https://github.com/yowls/dotfiles/tree/debian/.config/qtile/Bars)

Also you can use the bar you want, such as polybar,tint2, etc. Just delete [This Line](https://github.com/yowls/dotfiles/blob/debian/.config/qtile/config.py#L23) and in [autostart file](https://github.com/yowls/dotfiles/blob/debian/.config/qtile/autostart.sh) run the program of your choice.
